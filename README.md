# The Introduction of the MSc Project
## Overview
This project uses LLMs to perform sentiment analysis on financial news headlines to predict Bitcoin price trends. First we replicated FinBERTâ€™s performance and retrained it on GDELT subset to improve its accuracy from 64.8% to 73.8%. Next, three sentiment scores were extracted from GDELT news dataset using retranied FinBERT model and the results were aggregated to develop multiple sentiment signals. Then we calculate Bitcoin returns from Bitcoin price dataset and construct multiple return signals. By calculating Pearson correlation coefficient, we find that the continuous sum sigmoid sentiment signal demonstrates the strongest correlation with Bitcoin returns. Based on this, we designed trading strategies, with one consistently outperforming the buy-and-hold benchmark by 20 percentage points, even during volatile and bearish periods.

## Questions
- Can LLM-based model improve prediction of Bitcoin price movements?

- Is the sentiment from news titles connected with Bitcoin returns?

- Can sentiment-based strategies outperform traditional trading strategies?

## Tools
LLM: FinBERT (base + retrained)

Libraries: Transformers, PyTorch, pandas, NumPy, yfinance

Others: GDELT 2.0 event database for news

## Data Preparation

We downloaded and input the news data into a dataframe. Cleaned and preprocessed the text with relabeling, lowecasing, removing stopwords and lemmatization.

```python
input_df = pd.read_csv('finbert_600.csv')
df = input_df[['title','ground_truth']]
df.columns = ['news','labels']
df['labels'].replace({1:2},inplace=True)
df['labels'].replace({0:1},inplace=True)
df['labels'].replace({-1:0},inplace=True)


import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
df['news'] = df['news'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word not in (stop_words)]))
df["news"] = df["news"].str.lower()
df["news"] = df['news'].str.replace('[^\w\s]','')

from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

#Function to apply for each word the proper lemmatization.
def lemmetize_titles(words):
    a = []
    tokens = word_tokenize(words)
    for token in tokens:
        lemmetized_word = lemmatizer.lemmatize(token)
        a.append(lemmetized_word)
    lemmatized_title = ' '.join(a)
    return lemmatized_title

df['lemmetized_titles'] = df['news'].apply(lemmetize_titles)
```

For the Bitcoin Price data, we downloaded using yfinance library, changed the data types and finally enriched the dataset with daily and weekly returns.

```python
raw_price_df = pd.read_csv('BTC-USD_price.csv')
raw_price_df.columns = ['Date', 'Adj Close', 'Close', 'High', 'Low', 'Open', 'Volume']
raw_price_df = raw_price_df.iloc[2:].reset_index(drop=True)
price_df = raw_price_df[['Date','Close']]
price_df['Close'] = price_df['Close'].str.replace(',', '').astype(float)
price_df['1dayreturn'] = 0
for i in range(price_df['1dayreturn'].shape[0]-1):
    price_df['1dayreturn'][i] = (price_df['Close'][i+1] - price_df['Close'][i]) / price_df['Close'][i] * 100

price_df['1weekreturn'] = 0
for i in range(price_df['1weekreturn'].shape[0]-7):
    price_df['1weekreturn'][i] = (price_df['Close'][i+7] - price_df['Close'][i]) / price_df['Close'][i] * 100
price_df

```


## Analysis
1. FinBERT is retrained based on 600 manually labeled news headlines from GDELT 2.0 event database. The accuracy of the retrained FinBERT improved from 64.8% to 73.8%. ![retraining](retraining.png)

2. Using the retrained FinBERT model, the sentiment was extracted and 6 sentiment signals were built. Using the Bitcoin price data, 6 return signals were built as well. The best correlation exists between daily return signal and countinuous_sum_sigmoid sentiment signal.

3. Two different sentiment based strategies with different thresholds were backtested. The results show that the second sentiment strategy consistently outperforms the buy-and-hold benchmark by 20 percentage points, even during volatile and bearish periods![tradingsignal](sentiment3_2.png)

## Insights
- LLM-based sentiment analysis could enhance market insight and trading performance.
- It is necessary to retrain FinBERT model on GDELT 2.0 event database to improve its prediction's accuracy.
- The countinuous_sum_sigmoid signal best correlates with Bitcoin daily returns. It works as an indicator to instruct the tradin signal when to buy or sell the Bitcoin.
- Sentiment based strategy consistently shows a much higher and positive returns than the baseline buy-and-hold strategy.
- Advanced machine learning methods could be used to enhance the performance of the trading signal.
